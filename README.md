# fromjs

Invoke Clojurescript/Reagent components from js



## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. 

In the browser console write: 

    fromjs.core.change_person({name:"George"}); 

which will instantly change the name on the screen.
